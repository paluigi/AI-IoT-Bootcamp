"""I'm deciding to comment because I read so many painful reviews on here. I just got mine inserted yesterday. It was honestly not bad at all. The reason I think maybe my experience was different is because I was instructed to come in and have it inserted DURING my period. When you are menstruating, your cervix is more open so the procedure is easier and less painful. My period is almost over and honestly my cramps have been no different than any other period I've had. If you are deciding on Skyla as a birth control method, schedule your appointment during the heaviest day of your period when your cervix is nice and open.
